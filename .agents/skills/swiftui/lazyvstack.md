> A view that arranges its children in a line that grows vertically, creating items only as needed.

```swift
nonisolated struct LazyVStack<Content> where Content : View
```

## Overview

The stack is “lazy,” in that the stack view doesn’t create items until it needs to render them onscreen.

In the following example, a [ScrollView](/documentation/swiftui/scrollview) contains a `LazyVStack` that consists of a vertical row of text views. The stack aligns to the leading edge of the scroll view, and uses default spacing between the text views.

```swift
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(alignment: .leading) {
        ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
            Text("Row \($0)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Conforms To

- [View](/documentation/swiftui/view)

## Creating a lazy-loading vertical stack

- [init(alignment:spacing:pinnedViews:content:)](/documentation/swiftui/lazyvstack/init(alignment:spacing:pinnedviews:content:)) Creates a lazy vertical stack view with the given spacing, vertical alignment, pinning behavior, and content.

## Dynamically arranging views in one dimension

- [Grouping data with lazy stack views](/documentation/swiftui/grouping-data-with-lazy-stack-views) Split content into logical sections inside lazy stack views.
- [Creating performant scrollable stacks](/documentation/swiftui/creating-performant-scrollable-stacks) Display large numbers of repeated views efficiently with scroll views, stack views, and lazy stacks.
- [LazyHStack](/documentation/swiftui/lazyhstack) A view that arranges its children in a line that grows horizontally, creating items only as needed.
- [PinnedScrollableViews](/documentation/swiftui/pinnedscrollableviews) A set of view types that may be pinned to the bounds of a scroll view.
