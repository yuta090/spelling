**Instance Method**

# confirmationDialog(_:isPresented:titleVisibility:actions:)

**Available on:** iOS 15.0+, iPadOS 15.0+, Mac Catalyst 15.0+, macOS 12.0+, tvOS 15.0+, visionOS 1.0+, watchOS 8.0+

> Presents a confirmation dialog when a given condition is true, using a text view for the title.

```swift
nonisolated func confirmationDialog<A>(_ title: Text, isPresented: Binding<Bool>, titleVisibility: Visibility = .automatic, @ContentBuilder actions: () -> A) -> some View where A : View
```

## Parameters

**title**

The title of the dialog.

**isPresented**

A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the dialog. When the user presses or taps the dialog’s default action button, the system sets this value to `false`, dismissing the dialog.

**titleVisibility**

The visibility of the dialog’s title. The default value is [Visibility.automatic](/documentation/swiftui/visibility/automatic).

**actions**

A [ContentBuilder](/documentation/swiftui/contentbuilder) returning the dialog’s actions.

## Discussion

In the example below, a button conditionally presents a confirmation dialog depending upon the value of a bound Boolean variable. When the Boolean value is set to `true`, the system displays a confirmation dialog with a cancel action and a destructive action.

```swift
struct ConfirmEraseItems: View {
    @State private var isShowingDialog = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Empty Trash") {
            isShowingDialog = true
        }
        .confirmationDialog(
            Text("Permanently erase the items in the trash?"),
            isPresented: $isShowingDialog
        ) {
            Button("Empty Trash", role: .destructive) {
                // Handle empty trash action.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

All actions in a confirmation dialog will dismiss the dialog after the action runs. The default button will be shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the [defaultAction](/documentation/swiftui/keyboardshortcut/defaultaction) keyboard shortcut.

The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.

Dialogs include a standard dismiss action by default. If you provide a button with a role of [cancel](/documentation/swiftui/buttonrole/cancel), that button takes the place of the default dismiss action. You don’t have to dismiss the presentation with the cancel button’s action.

> **Note:** In regular size classes in iOS, the system renders confirmation dialogs as a popover that the user dismisses by tapping anywhere outside the popover, rather than displaying the standard dismiss action.

## Getting confirmation for an action
