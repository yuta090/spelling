**Navigation:** [SwiftUI](/documentation/swiftui) › [View](/documentation/swiftui/view)

**Instance Method**

# alert(_:isPresented:actions:)

**Available on:** iOS 15.0+, iPadOS 15.0+, Mac Catalyst 15.0+, macOS 12.0+, tvOS 15.0+, visionOS 1.0+, watchOS 8.0+

> Presents an alert when a given condition is true, using a text view for the title.

```swift
nonisolated func alert<A>(_ title: Text, isPresented: Binding<Bool>, @ContentBuilder actions: () -> A) -> some View where A : View
```

## Parameters

**title**

The title of the alert.

**isPresented**

A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the alert. When the user presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to `false` and dismisses.

**actions**

A [ContentBuilder](/documentation/swiftui/contentbuilder) returning the alert’s actions.

## Discussion

In the example below, a login form conditionally presents an alert by setting the `didFail` state variable. When the form sets the value to to `true`, the system displays an alert with an “OK” action.

```swift
struct Login: View {
    @State private var didFail = false
    let alertTitle: String = "Login failed."

    var body: some View {
        LoginForm(didFail: $didFail)
            .alert(
                Text(alertTitle),
                isPresented: $didFail
            ) {
                Button("OK") {
                    // Handle the acknowledgement.
                }
            }
    }
}
```

All actions in an alert dismiss the alert after the action runs. The default button is shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the [defaultAction](/documentation/swiftui/keyboardshortcut/defaultaction) keyboard shortcut.

The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.

If no actions are present, the system includes a standard “OK” action. No default cancel action is provided. If you want to show a cancel action, use a button with a role of [cancel](/documentation/swiftui/buttonrole/cancel).

On iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, alerts only support controls with labels that are [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text). Passing any other type of view results in the content being omitted.
