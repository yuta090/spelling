# Menu

**Available on:** iOS 14.0+, iPadOS 14.0+, Mac Catalyst 14.0+, macOS 11.0+, tvOS 17.0+, visionOS 1.0+

> A control for presenting a menu of actions.

```swift
nonisolated struct Menu<Label, Content> where Label : View, Content : View
```

## Overview

The following example presents a menu of three buttons and a submenu, which contains three buttons of its own.

```swift
Menu("Actions") {
    Button("Duplicate", action: duplicate)
    Button("Rename", action: rename)
    Button("Delete…", action: delete)
    Menu("Copy") {
        Button("Copy", action: copy)
        Button("Copy Formatted", action: copyFormatted)
        Button("Copy Library Path", action: copyPath)
    }
}
```

You can create the menu’s title with a [LocalizedStringKey](/documentation/swiftui/localizedstringkey), as seen in the previous example, or with a content builder that creates multiple views, such as an image and a text view:

```swift
Menu {
    Button("Open in Preview", action: openInPreview)
    Button("Save as PDF", action: saveAsPDF)
} label: {
    Label("PDF", systemImage: "doc.fill")
}
```

To support subtitles on menu items, initialize your `Button` with a view builder that creates multiple `Text` views where the first text represents the title and the second text represents the subtitle. The same approach applies to other controls such as `Toggle`:

```swift
Menu {
    Button(action: openInPreview) {
        Text("Open in Preview")
        Text("View the document in Preview")
    }
    Button(action: saveAsPDF) {
        Text("Save as PDF")
        Text("Export the document as a PDF file")
    }
} label: {
    Label("PDF", systemImage: "doc.fill")
}
```

> **Note:** This behavior does not apply to buttons outside of a menu’s content.

### Primary action

Menus can be created with a custom primary action. The primary action will be performed when the user taps or clicks on the body of the control, and the menu presentation will happen on a secondary gesture, such as on long press or on click of the menu indicator. The following example creates a menu that adds bookmarks, with advanced options that are presented in a menu.

```swift
Menu {
    Button(action: addCurrentTabToReadingList) {
        Label("Add to Reading List", systemImage: "eyeglasses")
    }
    Button(action: bookmarkAll) {
        Label("Add Bookmarks for All Tabs", systemImage: "book")
    }
    Button(action: show) {
        Label("Show All Bookmarks", systemImage: "books.vertical")
    }
} label: {
    Label("Add Bookmark", systemImage: "book")
} primaryAction: {
    addBookmark()
}
```

### Styling menus

Use the [menuStyle(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/menustyle(_:)) modifier to change the style of all menus in a view. The following example shows how to apply a custom style:

```swift
Menu("Editing") {
    Button("Set In Point", action: setInPoint)
    Button("Set Out Point", action: setOutPoint)
}
.menuStyle(EditingControlsMenuStyle())
```
